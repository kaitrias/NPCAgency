	<p>Welcome to NPC Agency. A program designed to provide minor
		characters for video games. Currently used with the Phaser2 engine.
		(https://phaser.io/) To create a completely random character
		just push the blue 'Saver' button. If you would like to adjusts some aspects
		of the character, expand the accordions below and make some changes. The basic information is the most straight forward and
		has details about where the person was born, how old he is, etc. The
		traits affect which events a person might experience and their
		description. The Eras section lets you influence the events in each
		era to be more positive or negative. <strong>To play the game, create a character, copy the seed, click the 'open game' button and follow the instructions in the game.</strong>
