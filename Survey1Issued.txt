"Note about whether I would use the tool. 
It really depends on what I'm trying to do. If I just want generic NPC characters, 
and especially if I want a large number of them, I would likely use the tool. 
However, if I only want a few characters, especially if I want them to all be significantly 
different or have some specific traits, I would be unlikely use the tool."
